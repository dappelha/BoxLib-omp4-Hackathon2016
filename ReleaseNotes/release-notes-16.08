        Release Notes for BoxLib 16.08

The development branch was merged into master on Auguest 1, 2016.

* New Features
** Sidecars have been merged into the master branch.  
See BoxLib/Docs/Readme.sidecars for more details.

* Bug Fixes
** Fix a minor bug in Fortran tilearray counter for memory profiling.
Note that this bug affected neither simulation results nor actual memory usage.

* Backward Incompatible Changes
** BoxArray::define(const BoxArray& rhs)
has been removed.  "lhs = rhs" can be used instead.
** Remove edge_restriction.f90 because all its functions are already duplicated in 
cc_restrition_module and the edge restriction functions are called by
functions in ml_cc_restriction_module.  Note that there is no
ml_edge_restriction_module. 

* Major Changes
** Parallel communication cache
is reimplemented using BoxArray/DistributionMap keys.  The new
approach avoids holding up BoxArrays that have been removed from the
run.
** VisMF is now class for FabArray<FArrayBox>, not just MultiFab.
** Fortran random module now support single precision.
** Fortran random module allows using FluctHydro/HydroGrid distribution.
** Lots of improvement in the regressing test script.
** Coarsened BoxArrays are kept in cache as long as the fine BoxArray is alive.
This can avoid building coarse BoxArrays again and again.
** bl_deallocate now nullifies fortran pointer. 
** Memory profiling now keeps track of the number of BoxArrays and MultiFabs.
** Fourth order interpolation in fillpatch in Fortran BoxLib 
now sets stencil width automatically.
** Write a plotfile on demand with plot_and_continue

* Make System
** 'make file_locations' will printout where in the VPATH each source file is found
as well as indicate which files are not found.
** Make.local: Users now can have its own Make.local.  Because it is included
near the very end of setting up make definitions, one can use to
override variables such as compiler options.
** New options USE_VTUNE and USE_ITTNOTIFY for Intel compilers.
** HPGMG: DUNLIMIT_FMG_VCYCLES -> DUNLIMIT_FMG_VCYCLES
** Add libquadmath when compiling with gfortran
