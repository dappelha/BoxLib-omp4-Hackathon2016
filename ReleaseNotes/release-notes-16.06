        Release Notes for BoxLib 16.06

The development branch was merged into master on Jun 4, 2016.

* New Features
** Fortran bl_random_module
There is a new random number module in Fortran BoxLib.  This module
used C++11's random number generator, Mersenne Twister, and provides
uniform real, normal, Poisson, and binomial distributions.  Unlike the
other existing random number generators in both C++ and Fortran
BoxLib, this new module allows multiple independent random number
generators.  If this feature is needed in C++ BoxLib codes, we can
implement this in C++ BoxLib too.
** Multi-Color
This allows us to split the default MPI communicator into
boxlib.ncolors sub-communicators.  See Tutorials/MultiColor_c for an
example of solving multiple linear systems in multiple
sub-communicators.
** Improved regression test script
** Added nodal injection

* Major Changes
** FillPatchIterator and FluxRegister now use parallel copy and FillBoundary 
functions instead of CollectData for communication if
amr.blocking_factor is large enough (e.g., >=8 when filling 4 ghost
cells with second spatial interpolation).  This avoids the use of
MPI_Alltoall. 
** DistributionMap now use std::pair<int,int> instead of int as key to the cache.
The first of the pair is the number of boxes.  The second is used to
represented communicator color.  However, it can also be used for
general purpose to allow BoxArrays with the same number of boxes to
be distributed differently.

* Make System
** removed some old machines and Intel < 13
** Support for F90 file preprocessing in Fortran BoxLib
** disable -g on PGI when using OpenACC for performance reason
