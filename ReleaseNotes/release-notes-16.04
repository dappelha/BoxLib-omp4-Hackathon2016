        Release Notes for BoxLib 16.04

The development branch was merged into master on Apr 11, 2016.

* Bug Fixes
** 1075b6babb32227 and ce604a709b0e22e8c
Fix a memory leak in CollectData(): must call MPI_Wait even though the
messages have been successfully sent.  This bug was fixed was in
16.03.1.
** 8bae1b5c81a4166862
Fix a bug in Fortran bndry_reg when the fine level has a single box
and covers the entire non-periodic domain.

* Backward Incompatible Changes
** 652dc2b991dc7d1c3175
The flux we pass into the F90 interface (in ml_solve.f90) for
cell-centered multigrid solvers now starts at the base level of the
solve, not one level higher.  See fbf65dd6143a1 for an example of
changes required.

* Other Changes
** Memory Profiler in C++: To Use it, compile with "MEM_PROFILE=TRUE".
** New version of restricted build to ml_layout that takes a minimum and maximum.
And a shallow copy is performed on ml_layout and ml_boxarray.
** New routine in Fortran MultiGrid to do a nodal sum and nodal volume, weighting 
faces, edges, and corners appropriately
** Allow for factor 4 as well as factor 2 interpolation in create_umac_grown in Fortran.
** Add the option in the F90 interfaces to the cell-centered solver to have the
base level have Dirichlet boundary conditions at a distance away from
the boundary, not just at the boundary.  You make this happen by
passing in base_level > 1 and crse_ratio = the ratio of dx between the
coarsest level of the solve to the coarser AMR level outside the
solve.
** Define BL_PROFILE_VAR_NS when PROFILE=TRUE
** Disable SIGFPE trapping by default.
** Clean up BLMap.
** Slack support in regression testing.
** Valgrind support in regression testing.
** Decrease the default max # allowed in Fortran copyassoc.
** Fix CMake for F_BaseLib.
** Utility from Aleks that writes the contents of a 2d plotfile into a text file,
one line per data point

* Compilers
** GCC does not correctly inline some of the functions.  We had to explicitly
use the noinline attribute on a few functions.
** Add C++11 for Cray.
** Turn off debug symbols for optimized code with Cray, because using
"-g" or "-G2" significantly reduces code performance. 
** Add more debug information flags to Intel.
** Remove explicit "-lmpich" flag for Edison and Cori. 
** Optimization reports for Cray.
** Use gnu99 instead of c99 for GNU because some of the strtok_r function we use 
in Combustion/Chemistry is not a standard C99 function.
