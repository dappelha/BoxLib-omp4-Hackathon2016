        Release Notes for BoxLib 16.07

The development branch was merged into master on July 5, 2016.

* Bug Fixes
** Fortran BoxLib ml_layout
In subroutine ml_layout_build that takes a layout array as input, set
the pmask flag in ml_layout to that of the input layout array.
** C++ IArrayBox
IArrayBox::Initialize should return immediately if it has been called
already. 

* Backward Incompatible Changes
** Fortran bl_random_module
Separate engine from distribution following C++ standard.  This makes
the module more flexible. 

* Other Changes
** Tiling in Fortran linear solvers
The cell-centered non-skewed GSRB and restriction are tiled.
** Floating point exceptions trapping
The backtrace module in Fortran BoxLib has a new subroutine
set_fpe_trap that can be used to turn on floating point exceptions
trapping. The exceptions include NaNs, divided by zero, and overflow.
** Tools/Postprocessing/F_Src/fcompare.f90
It now has the ability to inspect the zone where the largest error
(for a given variable) is set.

* Compiler Issues
** GCC 6.1.1
GCC 6.1.1 has a bug that affects Fortran BoxLib's function
init_layout_tilearray.  By changing it from function to subroutine
fixes the issue.
