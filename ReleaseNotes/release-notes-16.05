        Release Notes for BoxLib 16.05

The development branch was merged into master on May 2, 2016.

* Bug Fix
** e972938c3b825e2fd96c353e50492f4a0b045884
This commit fixed a bug in Geometry::PeriodicCopy when copying into
the destination's ghost cells.  Parallel-copying into ghost cells is a
new feature.  It's unlikely any code has been using it.

* New Features
** New runtime parameter DistributionMapping.node_size=0. 
When space-filling curve (SFC) is used for DistributionMapping and
this parameter is changed to say 24 on Edison, every 24 MPI processes
will be in the same team for a chunk of SFC, and the Knapsack scheme
is then used inside the team to further distribute the boxes to
individual processes.  For flat MPI runs, this might help load
balance while maintaining data locality.
** TINY_PROFILE
This profiler only supports a tiny fraction of what the full BoxLib
profiler can offer.  However, it does not need post-processing to
obtain inclusive times and it does not write any data to the disk
(other than the final report to stdout).
